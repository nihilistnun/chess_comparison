This is my Chess project for my stage 3 dissertation at Newcastle University

I am forking a [chess_console](https://github.com/jeromevonk/chess_console) project from this [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214018/Chess-console-game-in-Cplusplus).

This repository is now archieved to retain forked status, the updated repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nihilistnun/chess_algorithms).
